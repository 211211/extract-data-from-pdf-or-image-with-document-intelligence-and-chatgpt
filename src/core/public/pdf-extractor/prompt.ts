  'Extract all the biomarker output json format as below: [{"biomarker_name": name of the biomarker, "biomarker_value": value of the biomarker, "unit": unit of the biomarker, "reference_range": reference range of the biomarker, "category": category that biomarker belongs to }] If 1 biomarker has multiple values, units and reference ranges, please create corresponding results for that, for example: Input: Haemotalogy Neutrophils 66 % 5.5 x 10^9/L (2.0 - 7.0) Result: [{"biomarker_name": "Neutrophils", "biomarker_value": "66", "unit": "%", "reference_range": "NA", "category": "Haemotalogy" }, {"biomarker_name": "Neutrophils", "biomarker_value": "5.5", "unit": "10^9/L", "reference_range": "(2.0 - 7.0)", "category": "Haemotalogy" }] If reference range is text like Nil, negative, positive..., you must return the format of: reference_range: normal value Biomarkers like Blood Group, Urine Transparency, Colour... should be included if it\'s existed Don\'t be confused by reference range table, and this table is not biomarker You must keep the same text in the image, return the json output only, don\'t include ```json in the response. If you can\'t find the information in the image of any required field, make the default value as \'NA\'. If the value contains unit, try to split it into value and unit Keep all the number as text. Anywhere with None, you must replace by \'NA\'. Don\'t include the unit in the reference_range. Some popular unit is x10^9/L, x10^9g/L, x10^12g/L, x10^12, x10^12 g/L, x10^12/L, x10^6, x10^6 g/L, x10^6/L. For those you should return the unit with the pretty format, for example 10^12 g/L, 10^9/L';
